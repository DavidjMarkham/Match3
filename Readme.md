# Space Blast

Space Blast is a Match 3 style game that I built in the Godot game engine as a way to learn the Godot engine. It was based on the tutorial series here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhykrMFHOV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhykrMFHOV4) 

It is available on the Android Google Play store, yyou can read more about it here: [https://cybersentient.games/2019/06/04/space-blast-update-2-game-a-month-may-2019/](https://cybersentient.games/2019/06/04/space-blast-update-2-game-a-month-may-2019/)

You can test the game by downloading and installing Godot 3.1: [https://godotengine.org/download/windows](https://godotengine.org/download/windows)
Git clone this repo and open the project in Godot 3.1
